**Retrieval-Based Product Recommendation with Two-Tower Models: A Semantic Approach Using the Amazon ESCI Dataset**

This is Sarah Popeck and Nicholas Nehemia's final project repository for CS6220. 
Notes:
- Our training dataset is "train_balanced_25k.csv"
- Our test dataset is "test_4k_nonoverlap.csv"
- You can find the original dataset that we pulled from at https://github.com/amazon-science/esci-data/tree/main/shopping_queries_dataset

There are three notebooks in our repository. Two were working/experimentation notebooks ("ESCI Data Exploration.ipynb" and twoTowers.ipynb). The last, "Model Summary.ipynb," contains our four finalized models for easy reference and improved user readibility.

In order to run our code, you will need to ensure you have all of the requirements installed, which are found in requirements.txt. After that, you should be able to run our notebooks.

Thanks for viewing!
